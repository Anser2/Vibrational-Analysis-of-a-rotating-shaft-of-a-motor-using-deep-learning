This repository is end semester project for the 6th semester, I am doing vibrational analysis on a rotating shaft of a motor (DC/Induction), I'll take vibrational sensor data and apply various deep learning techniques such as 
convolutional neural network or feed forward neural network to detect faults and other problems, make sure to checkout ReadmeFirst text file for more info.
